### INFO:
This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the November 2017 update of the SEER Program from NCI, which provides population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast (histology codes 8522/3 from the SEER Primary City Recode) diagnosed between 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumor size, examined regional lymph nodes, positive regional lymph nodes, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were included.
